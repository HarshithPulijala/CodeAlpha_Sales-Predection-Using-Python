## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

We used **Linear Regression** to model the relationship between advertising spend and sales. Model evaluation was done using:

- **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains variance in sales.
- **Coefficient Analysis**: Shows the relative impact of each channel on sales.

### 🔍 Model Insights:

- **Radio** advertising showed the strongest positive impact on sales.
- **TV** had a moderate effect.
- **Newspaper** had a minimal influence.

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Pairplot**: To examine relationships between features.
- **Heatmap**: To show feature correlation.
- **Regression Line**: Actual vs Predicted sales.
